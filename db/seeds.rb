# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# 10.times do
# categories = Category.create([
# 	{name: Faker::Commerce.department, description: Faker::Company.bs}
	
# 	])
# end

# 50.times do
# services = Service.create([
# 	{name: Faker::Company.catch_phrase, description: Faker::Company.bs, price: Faker::Commerce.price, picture: "random.jpg", seller_id: rand(1..9), category_id: rand(1..9), text: Faker::Lorem.paragraph}
# 	])
